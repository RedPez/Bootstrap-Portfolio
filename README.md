# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

The challenge this week was to recreate our portfolio website using Bootstrap.

The acceptance criteria included:

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

1. Create a new GitHub repositories and name it `Bootstrap-Portfolio`.

2. Clone this repository to your computer.

3. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create the folder structure for the webpage.

   - Create a folder structure.

     - Create a `index.html`.

     - Create a `css` folder.

       - Inside create a `style.css` file.

   - Create an `images` folder.

     - Place all your images in this folder.

4. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   The website should include the following bootstrap components:

   - A Navigation bar

   - A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.

     - Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.

       - Links should navigate to the appropriate sections

   - A hero section

     - A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

   - A work section

     - A section displaying your work in grid.

       - If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/

     - Use bootstrap cards for each project.

       - The description should give a brief overview of the work.

     - Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

   - A skills section

     - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

   - An about / contact section.

     - An "About Me" section in the same row.

   - A footer section.

     - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

     - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

5. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

6. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## Credits

The majority of this website was coded using my own knowledge and the material provided to us on the course.
I used a tutorial to add scrolling text and the source code for this can be found here: (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/).

Thanks need to got to Bobbi Tarkany (tutor), who helped me troubleshoot an issue with the margins and padding on my work section, with my scrolling text affect, and spent some time giving me deeper insight into Bootstrap and how it can be utlised.
